Have you seen this essay on churchofjesuschrist.org?

The footnotes gave me a bit of a shock actually. It said that Joseph Smith married between 30-40 women, 12-14 were already married to other living men, that he was intimate with his wives (one as young as 14) and the he possibly had 2-3 children with them.
            
That can't be right can it?
